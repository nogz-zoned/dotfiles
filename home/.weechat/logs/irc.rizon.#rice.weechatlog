2015-11-08 14:47:11	~oneesama	compared to my current trackpad everything is good though

2015-11-08 14:47:56	~oneesama	I didn't get a chance to play around with force touch
2015-11-08 14:47:59	~oneesama	but I've used it on an iphone 6s
2015-11-08 14:48:07	~oneesama	and it's seriously like magic
2015-11-08 14:48:10	Plez	the force touch stuff like pushing down past a normal click
2015-11-08 14:48:13	Plez	is like whatever

2015-11-08 14:59:11	~oneesama	if so then you could just add a brightness command to your ~/.profile I guess

2015-11-08 14:59:57	~oneesama	yeah, what I'm saying is run a command at login to set it properly
2015-11-08 15:00:01	+bixxx	when the module starts
2015-11-08 15:00:09	~oneesama	unless grub is unreadable

2015-11-09 09:39:09	+codedwrench	you program it serially, using a serial to usb converter
2015-11-09 09:39:12	sweglorde	tho its not like a raspi is much more imo
2015-11-09 09:39:17	+codedwrench	which a pi has on board
2015-11-09 09:39:23	+codedwrench	sweglorde: it actually is
2015-11-09 09:39:35	sweglorde	a pi is like if a dev board could be a fully functional computer

2015-11-09 09:40:11	sweglorde	i know but its kinda similar
2015-11-09 09:40:32	havado	my dads tp t61 has  a serial port
2015-11-09 09:40:33	sweglorde	or maybe those funky gpio pins are throwing me off
2015-11-09 09:40:33	havado	rare
2015-11-09 09:40:51	+codedwrench	arduino has a realtime os, which means it can only run one program at a time

2015-11-09 11:52:59	~oneesama	awesome is so good
2015-11-09 11:53:01	~oneesama	best tiling wm
2015-11-09 11:53:16	_VexatioN	codedwrench: how long are you gonna be hanging around in chat for?
2015-11-09 11:53:20	yuppie	why is awesome better than bspwm
2015-11-09 11:53:21	_VexatioN	its the best Dynamic WM i think
2015-11-09 11:53:37	~oneesama	yuppie: because hybrid tiling/floating
2015-11-09 11:53:44	_VexatioN	in my experience its a little nicer out of the box and supports floating more then bspwm
2015-11-09 11:53:50	~oneesama	yeah
2015-11-09 11:53:51	yuppie	you can float in bspwm too though
2015-11-09 11:53:57	_VexatioN	most of the desktops are set to float by standard
2015-11-09 11:54:02	~oneesama	it's much nicer in awesome though, as far as I've seen
2015-11-09 11:54:06	_VexatioN	same
2015-11-09 11:54:09	+codedwrench	i like awesome wm for it's tweakability i like i3 for it's tiling
2015-11-09 11:54:10	~oneesama	it feels like it was built for floating 
2015-11-09 11:54:10	_VexatioN	bspwm is gr8 for tiling
2015-11-09 11:54:12	~oneesama	and not just tacked on
2015-11-09 11:54:20	_VexatioN	^
2015-11-09 11:54:27	_VexatioN	codedwrench: how long you gonna be here for?
2015-11-09 11:54:29	~oneesama	bspwm has good tiling but the floating just feels like it was slapped in 
2015-11-09 11:54:33	+codedwrench	_VexatioN: quite some time i suppose
2015-11-09 11:54:35	_VexatioN	ok
2015-11-09 11:54:40	~oneesama	I do like bspwm tho
2015-11-09 11:54:42	_VexatioN	im gonna catch a bus home in like 5 mins
2015-11-09 11:54:47	~oneesama	it's very nice 
2015-11-09 11:54:47	_VexatioN	can i steal your config?
2015-11-09 11:55:01	_VexatioN	the rice i have there is bspwm

2015-11-09 16:14:01	&lunarmage	another one
2015-11-09 16:14:18	Uncled1023	Because their services may be interpreting the host differently
2015-11-09 16:14:32	&lunarmage	~c:#chan isn't even a valid host
2015-11-09 16:14:37	Uncled1023	exactly
2015-11-09 16:14:51	&lunarmage	I was thinking it's probably a special +b

2015-11-11 01:46:16	jiaxsun	question: why use tilde over single or double quote

2015-11-11 01:55:25	LambdaComplex	because bash uses -gt and -lt for that shit
2015-11-11 01:55:32	LambdaComplex	so replace > with -gt and < with -lt
2015-11-11 01:55:41	jiaxsun	lol i tried that before
2015-11-11 01:55:45	jiaxsun	when i still had the quotes lol
2015-11-11 01:55:49	jiaxsun	lemme try now

2015-11-11 01:57:03	jiaxsun	that happens when i try to lower the volume from 100%
2015-11-11 01:57:16	jiaxsun	100 works fine and has no errors and shows the right chare
2015-11-11 01:57:30	jiaxsun	but when i lower it it just shows the empty glyphs, the last else case
2015-11-11 01:57:40	LambdaComplex	hm
2015-11-11 01:57:47	LambdaComplex	jiaxsun: change the brackets to double brackets

2015-11-11 01:57:56	LambdaComplex	and such
2015-11-11 01:58:22	LambdaComplex	that guide i linked to says && is only supported by [[
2015-11-11 01:58:37	LambdaComplex	though you could do [ foo ] && [ bar ] i guess

2015-11-11 01:59:19	LambdaComplex	conditionals are so useful
2015-11-11 01:59:24	jiaxsun	jesus i hate computers
2015-11-11 01:59:32	LambdaComplex	jiaxsun: change the = to -eq in line 20 then?
2015-11-11 01:59:45	LambdaComplex	and change that to double brackets for consistency's sake i guess
2015-11-11 02:00:19	jiaxsun	changed it to -ge
2015-11-11 02:00:28	jiaxsun	yep did the doubles now
2015-11-11 02:00:32	jiaxsun	it works i guess
2015-11-11 02:00:37	jiaxsun	but now i need to find better glyphs
2015-11-11 02:00:40	jiaxsun	:)
2015-11-11 02:01:02	LambdaComplex	also i think case might be a saner way to do that than if...elif
2015-11-11 02:01:14	LambdaComplex	not that that way won't work
2015-11-11 02:02:47	Plez	ty based bash wizards

2015-11-11 02:14:07	Plez	like 50% of the time i make a bash script i gotta google stuff i already know

2015-11-11 04:38:01	Plez	thats all sjw movement is about
2015-11-11 04:38:14	eric_	That's why when people say "the average male height is 5' 7"" it doesn't matter
2015-11-11 04:38:28	eric_	Because it's all the other races bringing that shit way down except black people because they're usually tall
2015-11-11 04:38:36	Plez	i looked at the average aus height
2015-11-11 04:38:39	Plez	it seems wrong
2015-11-11 04:38:44	Plez	maybe aboriginals are short 
2015-11-11 04:38:46	 *	Plez shrugs
2015-11-11 04:38:56	Plez	cause im 6'2" and theres lots of people taller than me
2015-11-11 04:39:13	eric_	176  hmm
2015-11-11 04:39:22	Plez	actually aboriginals are short because of generations of poverty
2015-11-11 04:39:24	 *	eric_ shrugs
2015-11-11 04:39:47	Plez	thats why african americans are huge

2015-11-11 04:40:05	eric_	lol
2015-11-11 04:40:33	eric_	tfw average australian male height is still slightly taller than me

2015-11-11 04:40:51	eric_	by .74 cm ;-;
2015-11-11 04:40:54	eric_	AAA
2015-11-11 04:41:06	Plez	i probably just have a fragile ego
2015-11-11 04:41:12	Plez	but i dont like people being taller than me
2015-11-11 04:41:16	Plez	so im glad im taller than average
2015-11-11 04:41:35	Plez	also skewes them bmi stats so i can be a lil bit too fat
2015-11-11 04:41:38	Plez	but still say im average
2015-11-11 04:41:42	eric_	it's prolly because youre taller than average so it doesn't happen a lot
2015-11-11 04:41:49	Plez	yeah thats a good point actually
2015-11-11 04:42:06	Plez	id have a pretty miserable existence if i was 5foot gettin but blasted when people were taller than me
2015-11-11 04:42:14	eric_	when other dudes are taller than me it's like eh w/e i know
2015-11-11 04:42:18	eric_	HOWEVER
2015-11-11 04:42:27	eric_	there are lots of tall girls at my school ;-;
2015-11-11 04:42:29	Plez	just means you fit in the rockets easier
2015-11-11 04:42:30	eric_	who are taller than me
2015-11-11 04:42:34	eric_	right true
2015-11-11 04:43:06	eric_	I was watching something on the moon missions and they said that one of them was tall for an astronaut, and he was 6'
2015-11-11 04:43:13	eric_	they probably fixed that shit by now
2015-11-11 04:43:22	Plez	i think they still prefer small
2015-11-11 04:43:28	Plez	since even grams matter
2015-11-11 04:43:29	Plez	for the cost
2015-11-11 04:43:34	eric_	true
2015-11-11 04:43:44	eric_	also i think it has to do with the G's you can pull and whatever

2015-11-11 06:20:29	Gabou	I'm using netctl, had a rough time using eduroam on it
2015-11-11 06:20:48	Gabou	Is it easy to use like the graphical nm-applet?
2015-11-11 06:20:53	_VexatioN	codedwrench: you're just using lain right? i tried to restart awesome and i got an error that it couldnt fine 'volume'
2015-11-11 06:21:14	+codedwrench	yeah look at the path, volume is one of my own scripts
2015-11-11 06:21:32	+codedwrench	and it uses pactl, so if you're not using pulse you might wanna change it
2015-11-11 06:21:53	_VexatioN	ill just install pulce
2015-11-11 06:21:54	_VexatioN	*pulse
2015-11-11 06:22:01	_VexatioN	i think it'll make my life easier
2015-11-11 06:22:21	_VexatioN	uh, where should I put volume.lua?
2015-11-11 06:22:33	+codedwrench	look at the rc.lue
2015-11-11 06:22:34	+codedwrench	look at the rc.luea

2015-11-11 06:23:36	_VexatioN	x)

2015-11-11 07:08:38	_VexatioN	or '76'

2015-11-11 08:22:49	_Vexation	codedwrench: which lines did you say to edit in the xmonad patch to reverse it's effects?
2015-11-11 08:24:56	+codedwrench	58 - 68 i believe
2015-11-11 08:25:28	+codedwrench	need to change the * into divides
2015-11-11 08:25:52	+codedwrench	the 3*useless gaps and 2*uselessgaps 
2015-11-11 08:26:19	+codedwrench	so it will be half the size 
2015-11-11 08:26:24	+codedwrench	instead of double
2015-11-11 08:26:44	+codedwrench	and then just double the useless gap size you had set
2015-11-11 08:27:18	_Vexation	it fucked me up
2015-11-11 08:27:29	_Vexation	i dont know what c, geometry, useless+gap, and swap are
2015-11-11 08:27:36	_Vexation	ok well i know what useless_gap is
2015-11-11 08:27:54	+codedwrench	yeah if you compare this one with the default one
2015-11-11 08:28:00	+codedwrench	it doesnt do it times 2
2015-11-11 08:28:08	+codedwrench	so if you now divide it by 2
2015-11-11 08:28:22	+codedwrench	inner gaps will be half the outer gaps
2015-11-11 08:28:39	_Vexation	you would think that right
2015-11-11 08:28:56	_Vexation	maybe i fucked something up but it removes the inside gaps completely and moves all of the windows down and right
2015-11-11 08:29:52	_Vexation	nah i just broke it myself
2015-11-11 08:29:55	_Vexation	doing something else
2015-11-11 08:31:37	_Vexation	yeah it just fucked it up for some reason
2015-11-11 08:32:45	+codedwrench	i'll be getting home late today, but i'll see if i can get it working when i have some time
2015-11-11 08:33:19	+codedwrench	looking at the code, that really is the only thing that changed

2015-11-11 12:37:21	Plez	but it should be playable
2015-11-11 12:37:22	cflag	Medium/low should be smooth
2015-11-11 12:37:24	Plez	if youre worried pirate it first
2015-11-11 12:37:27	Plez	thats my advice
2015-11-11 12:37:41	Plez	then if you like it, buy it when the dlc comes out
2015-11-11 12:37:48	Plez	it should be cheaper by that point
2015-11-11 12:38:03	jumi	yeah i'm definitely pirating it
