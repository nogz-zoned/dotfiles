2015-11-01 00:24:10	Ox0dea	What's the cleanest way to tab-complete to a previous message, ideally from all available sources.
2015-11-01 00:26:15	semeion	Ox0dea: nice question, i could use something like this too

2015-11-01 00:27:04	Ox0dea	semeion: Any insight into the matter?
2015-11-01 00:27:33	semeion	probably it already exist in weechat, but i don´t know the key/attach
2015-11-01 00:29:04	semeion	i will try find it with /key list
2015-11-01 00:29:45	Ox0dea	semeion: It's almost certainly not going to be native.
2015-11-01 00:30:18	Ox0dea	I'm sure the completion API is intuitive enough, but I figured I'd try not to reinvent a wheel if possible.
2015-11-01 00:30:42	semeion	weechat have alot of features, it maybe exist
2015-11-01 00:32:13	Ox0dea	Alas, the only script with "complete" in its description is zerotab.py, but that's for completing to the MRS.

2015-11-01 00:35:51	semeion	i maked an script to show me youtube titles when someone post youtube url
2015-11-01 00:36:09	semeion	i maked it like 3 years ago, and was easy
2015-11-01 00:36:34	Ox0dea	semeion: Well, then, let's bang this out, yeah? :)
2015-11-01 00:36:39	semeion	check weechat documentation if you know a bit of coding you can do it
2015-11-01 00:36:58	Ox0dea	semeion: There's an unfortunate language barrier between us. :<
2015-11-01 00:37:10	semeion	i don´t speak english very well, what means "let´s bang this out" ?
2015-11-01 00:37:13	semeion	lol
2015-11-01 00:37:29	Ox0dea	semeion: We both want this feature, and we can both code; let's team up! :P
2015-11-01 00:37:44	Ox0dea	Your preferred language probably isn't Ruby, though...

2015-11-01 00:39:50	Ox0dea	The only thing I'm worried about is not interfering with other completions; I'd want to have the lowest priority, and I don't think the completion API makes that trivial.

2015-11-01 05:47:20	srhb	When I open weechat it logs onto my irc bouncer which gives me some backlog. However, I usually have notifications play a sound on highlight of my name. This means that my soundcard nearly explodes with old messages on initial login. Is there a nice way to deal with this? Perhaps a throttle (or a way to disable notifications on startup) ? :-)

2015-11-01 10:05:35	sim642	which of the four msgbuffer target types is the default for "topic"?
2015-11-01 10:05:43	sim642	I don't see a way to find that out anywhere
2015-11-01 10:05:53	sim642	nor does it seem obvious from the types described there
2015-11-01 10:06:33	squirrel	btw, can we have whois stuff in a dialog window?
2015-11-01 10:06:48	squirrel	can weechat create dialog windows
2015-11-01 10:06:48	sim642	dialog?
2015-11-01 10:07:05	sim642	more like: does terminal have a concept of dialog window?
2015-11-01 10:07:15	squirrel	uh sure
2015-11-01 10:07:24	@nils_2	you'll have to script this function squirrel
2015-11-01 10:07:53	squirrel	nils_2: there's no api?
2015-11-01 10:08:12	sim642	squirrel, you mean dialog window from text on top of weechat?
2015-11-01 10:08:28	squirrel	yup
2015-11-01 10:08:30	sim642	weechat has no such concept
2015-11-01 10:08:37	squirrel	curses should be supporting that
2015-11-01 10:08:56	@nils_2	sim642: topic changes will be display in the corresponding buffer
2015-11-01 10:09:02	sim642	of course you can use curses to draw anything over itself but right now weechat does not support that
2015-11-01 10:09:21	squirrel	sad
2015-11-01 10:09:23	sim642	nils_2, I know that, but which of the four options would that be if I wanted to get that default behavior by setting irc.msgbuffer.topic
2015-11-01 10:09:39	@nils_2	ah! simply unset the option ;-)
2015-11-01 10:09:40	sim642	squirrel, you could code it of course
2015-11-01 10:10:09	squirrel	sim642: a script can access curses api?
2015-11-01 10:10:17	sim642	squirrel, no

2015-11-01 10:10:42	sim642	nils_2, so there are behaviors which can't be set by msgbuffer options
2015-11-01 10:10:50	squirrel	so you are saying i can code the api
2015-11-01 10:10:55	squirrel	and then code the script
2015-11-01 10:11:18	@nils_2	squirrel: no. but you can create a buffer, /window split, display the buffer in that split window  and redirect the /whois to your buffer
2015-11-01 10:11:19	sim642	of course you could
2015-11-01 10:11:34	SkepticalParrot	sim642: it works. Thanks. :)
2015-11-01 10:11:40	sim642	but yeah, the concept of dialogs isn't very IRC-like nor weechat like
2015-11-01 10:11:49	squirrel	nils_2: creating buffers is slow
2015-11-01 10:11:55	squirrel	who wants that
2015-11-01 10:12:05	sim642	what if all of a sudden your script wants to create 10 dialogs
2015-11-01 10:12:09	sim642	and another script wants 30 more

2015-11-01 10:12:20	@nils_2	even for weechat there are limitations ;-)
2015-11-01 10:12:23	sim642	because you left weechat running overnight and are not there to look at that
2015-11-01 10:12:41	sim642	it simply makes much more sense to have a log (buffer) of data
2015-11-01 10:12:43	squirrel	idk, other apps seem to have no problems with dialog windows
2015-11-01 10:13:02	sim642	squirrel, which terminal irc client does that?
2015-11-01 10:13:16	squirrel	i'd love to see a dialog window for server creation
2015-11-01 10:13:20	squirrel	and for triggers
2015-11-01 10:13:28	sim642	it's not an underlying limitation, it's simply the limitation that this hasn't been intended
2015-11-01 10:13:32	sim642	because it makes too little sense
2015-11-01 10:13:44	squirrel	does it
2015-11-01 10:13:56	sim642	read what I said about scripts wanting multiple dialogs
2015-11-01 10:14:25	squirrel	this discussion is meaningless since this is not going to happen anyway
2015-11-01 10:15:52	sim642	dialogs on top of weechat windows (splits) just introduces a myriad of issues IMO

2015-11-01 10:16:45	sim642	it's very intuitive to maybe want to write something into a channel while you have a dialog open
2015-11-01 10:16:53	sim642	so you'd need additional focusing behavior
2015-11-01 10:17:05	sim642	not to mention, it might overlap something you'd want to see at the same time

2015-11-01 10:17:43	sim642	modifying server/trigger options isn't really such complication
2015-11-01 10:17:47	sim642	you can use iset to do it
2015-11-01 10:18:14	squirrel	vim-style dialog windows would be best
2015-11-01 10:18:30	squirrel	push the screen up, push it back later
2015-11-01 10:19:00	sim642	I have no idea what a vim-style dialog looks like

2015-11-01 10:20:41	squirrel	type $ vim<CR>foo<ESC>:q<CR>
2015-11-01 10:20:53	squirrel	ifoo*
2015-11-01 10:21:26	sim642	so just a big red error text in the input bar?
2015-11-01 10:21:56	squirrel	did you do :w?
2015-11-01 10:21:58	squirrel	do :q
2015-11-01 10:22:40	sim642	I did just :q as you said: E37: No write since last change (add ! to override)
2015-11-01 10:22:53	--	irc: disconnected from server
