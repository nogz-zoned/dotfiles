2015-10-31 22:46:44	davidmichaelkarr	borschty: Just doing that continually.
2015-10-31 22:47:09	borschty	that looks like your file system might be corrupted
2015-10-31 22:47:19	nogz	how can i enable multimonitor workspaces?
2015-10-31 22:47:58	davidmichaelkarr	borschty: What should I do at this point?

2015-10-31 22:48:35	nogz	borschty: you're amazing
2015-10-31 22:49:01	borschty	davidmichaelkarr, maybe there is some kind of fsck tool for xfs, i don't know, i stopped using xfs after losing too much data to it several years ago
2015-10-31 22:51:10	davidmichaelkarr	borschty: After power cycling, and without editing the linux16 command line (still had rhgb and quiet), it showed the following lines at the end:
2015-10-31 22:51:41	nogz	would it be possible to it also switch on only one monitor?
2015-10-31 22:52:49	borschty	nogz, that's the default behavior

2015-10-31 22:55:32	davidmichaelkarr	borschty: Did erasing that aborted transaction just fix it?
2015-10-31 22:55:44	borschty	davidmichaelkarr, no idea
2015-10-31 22:56:10	davidmichaelkarr	borschty: Weird.  Guess I'll have to try rebooting again to be sure.
2015-10-31 22:56:28	davidmichaelkarr	borschty: Otherwise, it let me log in and it displayed my desktop.

2015-10-31 23:51:24	Quick_Wango	borschty: thay have both login screens
2015-10-31 23:51:37	Quick_Wango	the one on tty2 is shown by default
2015-10-31 23:52:41	borschty	how many instances of /usr/sbin/gdm are running?
2015-10-31 23:54:43	Quick_Wango	I see one /usr/bin/gdm

2015-10-31 23:57:13	borschty	and how many instances of gnome-shell are running and what are their commandline arguments?
2015-10-31 23:58:55	Quick_Wango	http://snag.gy/SZ6vw.jpg
2015-11-01 00:01:08	borschty	looks like what i said: one for the login screen, the other one for your user
2015-11-01 00:02:43	Quick_Wango	so thats normal? I can also log me in a second time on tty1
2015-11-01 00:02:53	borschty	yes
2015-11-01 00:03:42	Quick_Wango	why would that be possible?
2015-11-01 00:04:09	borschty	if you log in as phillipp, the one on tty2 will get unlocked if you log in as someone else, a new gnome-shell will get started on tty3 and tty1 will keep showing the login screen
2015-11-01 00:05:52	Quick_Wango	it seems to detect that phillip is already logged in on another tty and switches to that
2015-11-01 00:06:21	borschty	yes
2015-11-01 00:06:32	Quick_Wango	I remember being logged in twice on my laptop and I'm pretty sure the second instance was on tty1
2015-11-01 00:06:37	Quick_Wango	but I think that was 3.16
2015-11-01 00:07:25	borschty	gdm has prevented multiple logins of the same user since pretty much forever
2015-11-01 00:07:41	Quick_Wango	well then I found a bug I guess
2015-11-01 00:08:10	borschty	or maybe you were using startx back then
2015-11-01 00:09:17	Quick_Wango	"back then" was like 2 months ago and was pretty much the same setup
2015-11-01 00:09:45	Quick_Wango	maybe it's still happening, let my check

2015-11-01 00:10:37	Quick_Wango	I tested it on my desktop with a second user, the second session was started on tty5 for some reason
2015-11-01 00:11:09	Quick_Wango	oh I think I had tty3 and 4 already open before, that might be the reason for that
2015-11-01 00:11:19	borschty	yes
2015-11-01 00:11:33	Quick_Wango	what if I had activated all of them?
2015-11-01 00:12:38	borschty	no idea, but logind should take care of freeing them
2015-11-01 00:13:30	Quick_Wango	ok it seems fixed with 3.18, but it definitly happened with 3.16. it happened multiple times that I accidentally logged in twice and was confused when the shutdown dialog told my that I was still logged
2015-11-01 00:13:36	Quick_Wango	ok

2015-11-01 09:15:55	bs0d	Hello. I have installed a set of GNOME shell extensions, like the system monitor, but I cannot see it
2015-11-01 09:17:13	kilbith	bs0d, try to run them from the console and paste us the errors (if there are)
2015-11-01 09:18:49	bs0d	kilbith  so, for system-monitor extension (in example) how do I run it from the command line?  The command "system-monitor" is not found
2015-11-01 09:21:03	kilbith	oh, sorry i misunderstood, thought you were talking about the independant program

2015-11-01 09:56:40	myhau	does anybody know, how to force keypad keys like home, end, delete, page_up, page_down behave like normal home, end, delete etc ?
2015-11-01 09:57:26	myhau	because when I do xev and type keypad end key it prints KP_End and when I press normal end key it outputs End

2015-11-01 10:04:44	nogz	when I use GDM to login it puts gnome on TTY2 instead of replacing GDM with Gnome.
2015-11-01 10:04:50	nogz	how do I fix that?
2015-11-01 10:04:57	NanoSector	nogz, gdm does this by design
2015-11-01 10:05:12	NanoSector	myhau, in your terminal?
2015-11-01 10:07:07	nogz	NanoSector how do I make it autoswitch then so that I don't have to push ctrl+alt+F2 every time?
2015-11-01 10:07:43	NanoSector	that it should do automatically

2015-11-01 10:08:38	nogz	archlinux
2015-11-01 10:08:48	NanoSector	on my arch system it works automatically, at least
2015-11-01 10:09:37	nogz	I'll try again later I suppose, maybe I'm just impatient.
2015-11-01 10:09:48	NanoSector	could try asking in #archlinux
2015-11-01 10:10:00	NanoSector	but they're not friendly
