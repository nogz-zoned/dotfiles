2015-11-07 22:56:42	kurufu	you can imagine a blanking signal of any length between the consumption of frames it doesnt change the argument unless you assume the blanking interval to be literally 0 length or less than an engine interval. To assume it is less than an engine interval i dont care it wont incur latency but you have a shit engine speed.
2015-11-07 22:57:08	kurufu	or m,aybe i got that backwards.

2015-11-08 08:22:55	themadman	also, you should have into account that the company probably blocks tor
2015-11-08 08:23:04	themadman	also, tor is unnecessary
2015-11-08 08:23:18	themadman	you can use just a socks5 directly
2015-11-08 08:24:13	themadman	if you are willing to spend 2 dollars a month
2015-11-08 08:24:28	themadman	I would seriously recommend to get a VPS for that
2015-11-08 08:24:38	themadman	you could also use it for irc and shit
2015-11-08 08:24:54	themadman	and the VPS IP is less likely to be blocked
2015-11-08 08:25:04	pojefpoj	+1 for vps

2015-11-08 20:46:04	Leliana	The X1 intermediate has a cross signature so browsers trust it while the root propagates

This is a significant milestone since it means that visitors to websites using Let’s Encrypt certificates can enjoy a secure browsing experience with no special configuration required.
2015-11-08 20:46:28	@witheld	You can see an example of a server using a Let’s Encrypt certificate under a new cross-signed intermediate here.

2015-11-08 21:31:54	Cosmonaut	so.. telnet?
2015-11-08 21:31:54	&ne	like python is
2015-11-08 21:31:56	&ne	no no
2015-11-08 21:32:02	&ne	languages can be native or interpreted
2015-11-08 21:32:22	&ne	interpreted languages works like this, you write a script in text format and the `python` program (the interpreter) will run your code line by line
2015-11-08 21:32:35	Cosmonaut	by native you mean compiled?
2015-11-08 21:32:42	@witheld	not neccesarily, no
2015-11-08 21:32:43	&ne	native languages you write the code, a compiler turns your code into a executable file, and it gets run by the OS 'natively'
2015-11-08 21:32:58	@witheld	you can compile to bytecode for instance

2015-11-08 22:48:09	aluuuu	zig 
2015-11-08 22:48:14	%Kunoichi	If you want incremental backups use Git instead
2015-11-08 22:48:16	aluuuu	take off every zig
2015-11-08 22:48:19	%Kunoichi	too bad that only works for small files.
2015-11-08 22:48:31	Chocolate_Chip	Kunoichi, that's funny because it doesn't keep them identical anyway
2015-11-08 22:48:34	@witheld	Nautilus is Ubuntu's file browser
2015-11-08 22:48:35	%Kunoichi	CAN you use git to track large files like image libraries
2015-11-08 22:48:41	@witheld	Chocolate_Chip: it's supposed to
2015-11-08 22:48:44	%Kunoichi	Chocolate_Chip: it's Supposed to in theroy.
2015-11-08 22:49:05	@witheld	Kunoichi: I guess? But you'd waste a massive amount of disk space
2015-11-08 22:49:08	Chocolate_Chip	Wow. Now it is actually downloading
2015-11-08 22:49:20	Chocolate_Chip	I select "Download from Mega", I choose the root directory
2015-11-08 22:49:25	Chocolate_Chip	It actually is working now
2015-11-08 22:49:38	Chocolate_Chip	Why is software such shit
2015-11-08 22:49:44	%Kunoichi	IPut it this way, if you delete the file from your home computer, it will also be deleted from the cloud and other synched devices
2015-11-08 22:49:57	%Kunoichi	Cloud storage is for conveniant access, not backups.
2015-11-08 22:50:10	Chocolate_Chip	I think it stopped
2015-11-08 22:50:14	%Kunoichi	that said, some cloud storage sites have the ability to un-delete things.
2015-11-08 22:50:15	@witheld	I mean there are backup solutions
2015-11-08 22:50:24	@witheld	like CrashPlan

2015-11-08 22:50:54	@witheld	Well
2015-11-08 22:51:08	Chocolate_Chip	Oh. That's great
2015-11-08 22:51:13	@witheld	Cross off "cloud" and put "file synchronization software"
2015-11-08 22:51:13	%Kunoichi	>External hard drives are also not backups
2015-11-08 22:51:17	@witheld	what

2015-11-08 22:51:34	%Kunoichi	and likely to be destroyed in the same housefire
2015-11-08 22:51:42	@witheld	That's a backup, just not a off-site backup
2015-11-08 22:51:44	%Kunoichi	there is no such thing as a backup.
2015-11-08 22:51:48	@witheld	yes there is

2015-11-08 22:51:54	%Kunoichi	(i'm kidding)
2015-11-08 22:52:09	Chocolate_Chip	Now I don't know wtf it is doing
2015-11-08 22:52:13	%Kunoichi	the joke is the things most people use as backups are shitty solutions
2015-11-08 22:52:14	%rdr	i use teknik as a backup service
2015-11-08 22:52:22	%Kunoichi	which won't save your data in many common situations.

2015-11-08 22:53:34	@witheld	Best backup solution is backup locally often, backup to something like Crash Plan just as often, and backup every few months to a off-site backup
2015-11-08 22:53:40	Chocolate_Chip	I mean it already deleted important data I will never get back

2015-11-09 03:21:40	@witheld	Though, the bootloader _has_ to be hacked if there's a bootloader
2015-11-09 03:21:46	@witheld	can't buy a phone that was just abandoned
2015-11-09 03:22:10	Space_Cowboy	Do any of you have Walmart's Straight Talk thing? I'm also looking for a new carrier and they're cheap. Unlimited everything, although the data speeds are slowed considerably after a certain amount, but I don't use a lot of data in the first place.
2015-11-09 03:22:30	@witheld	Space_Cowboy, you probably just want to go through AT&T
2015-11-09 03:22:32	Nami	I'm on an ancient unlimited data plan from the Palm Trio days
2015-11-09 03:22:33	@witheld	er

2015-11-09 03:22:58	Nami	I heard Cricket was good
2015-11-09 03:23:13	@witheld	Cricket is CDMA
2015-11-09 03:23:17	%notafads	depends on location
2015-11-09 03:23:25	Space_Cowboy	I heard that Straight Talk has pretty good coverage, though, which is important because I'm 20 miles away from any town with more than a bar.
2015-11-09 03:23:33	@witheld	Hm yeah it's fine then
2015-11-09 03:23:42	@witheld	Your best choice for AT&T
2015-11-09 03:23:43	Nami	Yeah CMDA and Verizon's LTE bands have the best US coverage
2015-11-09 03:23:55	@witheld	No, that's, AT&T
2015-11-09 03:23:58	@witheld	seriously
2015-11-09 03:24:11	Space_Cowboy	I used to have Verizon, I didn't get any service where I live now.
2015-11-09 03:24:20	Nami	In the west coast/boonies?
2015-11-09 03:24:28	Space_Cowboy	Rural Midwest.

2015-11-09 03:27:29	@witheld	But anyway, that involves using CDMA

2015-11-09 03:27:39	Space_Cowboy	Nobody gives a shit about the Midwest in general, there isn't anything to give a shit about here anyway, unless you really like cows.
2015-11-09 03:28:05	Nami	CMDA is better tech lol. The only reason Europe used GSM is political.
2015-11-09 03:28:10	@witheld	No MNVOs with BYOD and all the phones you can bring to Sprint or Verizon are...Sprint or Verizon phones
2015-11-09 03:28:16	Nami	3G and 4G are CMDA derived techs for all providers anyway
2015-11-09 03:28:22	Nami	GSM has buzz too
2015-11-09 03:28:51	Nami	Nah Verizon legally can't block unlocked phones, they use whitelisting which means fuck all so long as you have an active plan
2015-11-09 03:28:57	%rdr	>CDMAIDS
2015-11-09 03:29:02	@witheld	They just don't exist
2015-11-09 03:29:05	Nami	I've been using unlocked CMDA phones since 2011
2015-11-09 03:29:11	Nami	That haven't been on the whitelist
2015-11-09 03:29:25	Space_Cowboy	Another question, why do apps act up when they're not updated? I haven't updated Chanu in forever because it got taken off of the app store, and now it doesn't display thumbnails. I can't find a replacement I like so I'll probably just download it on f-droid.
2015-11-09 03:29:37	@witheld	4chan changed the API
2015-11-09 03:29:50	Nami	Why would you use a mobile app for 4chan anyway?
2015-11-09 03:29:53	Nami	It has a great mobile site
2015-11-09 03:30:00	Nami	One of the better mobile sites out there
2015-11-09 03:30:14	@witheld	Nami I mean unbranded phones for it pretty much don't exist
2015-11-09 03:30:26	Nami	Android apps are shady as fuck anyway, use a site whenever possible
2015-11-09 03:30:29	@witheld	It's unlocked, but you're using a sprint or verizon phone
2015-11-09 03:30:44	Nami	Since most developers will ask for your dick pic and DNA sample just to do something in terms of permissions
2015-11-09 03:30:45	@witheld	Maybe you got it from somewhere else
2015-11-09 03:30:51	%rdr	wahh i cant trust clover even though i can see the source code
2015-11-09 03:30:57	Nami	My Moto X Pure Edition works on all bands
2015-11-09 03:31:01	Nami	and I have it on Verizon
2015-11-09 03:31:02	Nami	unbranded
2015-11-09 03:31:10	@witheld	It's rare, very rare
2015-11-09 03:31:10	Nami	unlocked bootloader
2015-11-09 03:31:15	Nami	Unlimited free hotspot too
2015-11-09 03:31:16	Space_Cowboy	It's just a lot easier to use an app. I've never actually compared the amount of data a browser uses vs an app.
2015-11-09 03:31:16	Nami	shit is nice
2015-11-09 03:31:35	@witheld	And that is a premium device
2015-11-09 03:31:42	Nami	If you're using a browser you can take advantage of the integrated android network throttling/data saver
2015-11-09 03:31:44	@witheld	He can't get something Moto G tier that isn't branded
2015-11-09 03:31:51	Nami	Since Android has a lot of control over how browsers render images/etc
2015-11-09 03:32:01	Nami	And if you use a browser you can block beacons/ads/etc without root
2015-11-09 03:32:04	+Siouxsie	Moto G is pretty nice
2015-11-09 03:32:09	Nami	Which saves data further
2015-11-09 03:32:21	Space_Cowboy	Will addons use data though?
2015-11-09 03:32:22	@witheld	what are you even talking about
2015-11-09 03:32:34	@witheld	Data saver is a thing built into Chrome
2015-11-09 03:32:36	Nami	I'm saying why use an app when the browser gives you more control
2015-11-09 03:32:50	Nami	And potentially less data leaking
2015-11-09 03:32:57	Nami	if you are on a limited data plan
2015-11-09 03:32:59	Space_Cowboy	I mostly use Firefox.
2015-11-09 03:33:08	@witheld	Probably much more leaking
2015-11-09 03:33:08	Nami	Yeah I use firefox on my cell personally
2015-11-09 03:33:12	Space_Cowboy	I am on a limited plan, which is why data conservation is important to me.
2015-11-09 03:33:13	Nami	love the add-ons
2015-11-09 03:33:25	@witheld	It's a 4chan app, it pulls some JSON, plus images and thumbnails
2015-11-09 03:33:31	Space_Cowboy	Thank fuck AndChat uses a negligible amount, a few megabytes a cycle.
2015-11-09 03:33:31	@witheld	er

2015-11-09 03:34:51	Space_Cowboy	witheld: Are you saying that an app uses less data than using my internet browser?
2015-11-09 03:34:55	+Siouxsie	haha wtf really?
2015-11-09 03:35:02	@witheld	Yes, in that case it definitely does
2015-11-09 03:35:05	Space_Cowboy	There aren't ads or anything like that so I figured it does use less.
2015-11-09 03:35:08	@witheld	Because again
2015-11-09 03:35:14	@witheld	you're pulling JSON and images

2015-11-09 03:36:43	@witheld	So you'll pull 16K + thumbnails
2015-11-09 03:37:37	Nami	You should also go into your settings for Android and enable restrict background data
2015-11-09 03:37:42	Nami	depending on the version of Android you have
2015-11-09 03:37:55	@witheld	you probably don't want to do that if you using any messaging anything
2015-11-09 03:37:57	Space_Cowboy	I know this is probably going to sound retarded, but if I download and install the Chanu APK will there be any problems with the existing app, or would it be like updating the app?
2015-11-09 03:38:10	@witheld	If they're signed by the same person, it will update
2015-11-09 03:38:14	@witheld	if not it will refuse

2015-11-09 16:54:04	kurufu	anyway thats one reason i dont like using c++ unless im writing everything myself. Using external libraries is literally learning their flavor of c++.
2015-11-09 16:54:20	+vitimiti	kurufu, I use C libraries kek
2015-11-09 16:54:24	+vitimiti	SDL2 and OpenGL
2015-11-09 16:55:14	+vitimiti	So, I've fixed all the bugs I had up until now, now it's time for shader parsers
2015-11-09 16:55:17	kurufu	C libraries have a lot of the same issues but their usually better about sticking to normal types in my experience (not opengl however...)
2015-11-09 16:55:57	kurufu	are you just using sdl for windowing or what?
2015-11-09 16:56:06	+vitimiti	SDL2 is the window part, yeah

2015-11-09 17:03:44	hospitaler	Wait, seriously, what's wrong with nano? I use it all the time for simple editing, and for any bigger projects I normally just use notepad or a similar text editor
2015-11-09 17:03:48	+vitimiti	kurufu, I'd use vim if I wanted to write code
2015-11-09 17:04:13	+vitimiti	Although I'd rather use gedit since it's a GUI program and I try avoiding the console for long time usage
2015-11-09 17:04:17	kurufu	Searching, opening multiple files, marks, general navigation. Isnt anywher near on par with vim or emacs.
2015-11-09 17:05:12	kurufu	I honestly dont even know if nano has search functionallity im just assuming it does.
2015-11-09 17:05:20	+vitimiti	Yes, it does

2015-11-09 17:05:50	kurufu	Lol
2015-11-09 17:06:21	kurufu	but yea thats just moving around and looking at stuff. For editing its even farther behind vim and emacs. Which is why i question anyone who uses it.
2015-11-09 17:06:25	+vitimiti	Yeah, I have the system in my native language kek
2015-11-09 17:06:56	+vitimiti	kurufu, for creating C++ files, I'd use QtCreator, then Gedit, then vim, then nano and THEN emacs

2015-11-09 17:07:44	+vitimiti	I knew it, and I hated it
2015-11-09 17:07:56	+vitimiti	Now I don't think I'd be capable of using it without going back to the tutorial
2015-11-09 17:08:06	kurufu	and gui's are a crutch but at least they are more usable than nano.

2015-11-09 21:00:40	--	jumiknight is now known as jumi
2015-11-09 21:00:45	hospitaler	This is anecdotal, by the way
2015-11-09 21:01:09	hospitaler	But if you happen to be using your own modem (which you should anyway), there's a chance that they can't actually monitor your data useage
2015-11-09 21:01:22	hospitaler	Since they'd need to know the model of your modem in order to tell how much data you are using.
2015-11-09 21:02:15	hospitaler	I've used over a terabyte of data this month on Comcast, and I definitely live in an area where the data caps are enabled
2015-11-09 21:02:27	hospitaler	And my bill that I'm about to pay is $55 a month, sam as it was before the caps.

2015-11-11 09:54:51	tyil	I was there when they killed it :(
2015-11-11 09:54:57	Tadpole	tyil: I feel you man
2015-11-11 09:55:14	tyil	it was a debian machine, so it was for the best to put it down
2015-11-11 09:55:33	Tadpole	I had an OS teacher that told fond stories about the “eternal uptime”-machine at his old job

2015-11-11 09:56:01	Tadpole	He wasn't even allowed to use it when he started working there, because everyone was tense about someone fucking something up that would require a reboot to fix.
2015-11-11 09:56:07	tyil	it wouldn't have died on its own, it would just live and suffer daily :(
2015-11-11 09:56:27	Tadpole	tyil: Did you update it?
2015-11-11 09:56:32	+cflag	I doubt my server will reboot with a year of queued kernel updates

2015-11-11 09:57:33	tyil	I heard that it was a forgotten server
2015-11-11 09:57:42	tyil	so it was probably running 9yo software :p
