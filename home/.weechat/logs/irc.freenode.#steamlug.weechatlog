2015-10-31 23:09:03	Mneuro	Axiom Verge is awesome.
2015-10-31 23:09:08	Mneuro	I have it for ps4
2015-10-31 23:09:21	Mneuro	It is a complete rip off of Metroit
2015-10-31 23:09:24	Mneuro	Metroid*
2015-10-31 23:10:58	razieliyo	it's amazingly awesome
2015-10-31 23:11:07	razieliyo	I bought it today, definitely a MUST TO
2015-10-31 23:11:11	razieliyo	IN BIG WORDS YOU HEAR?
2015-10-31 23:11:36	razieliyo	I just scratched a little of it
2015-10-31 23:11:49	razieliyo	I just have 4 weapons and there are slots for 20 more lol
2015-10-31 23:12:23	razieliyo	Mneuro, don't you sometimes think it's even better than any other metroid?
2015-10-31 23:13:12	razieliyo	that way of copying the ball ability :3
2015-10-31 23:13:58	razieliyo	I suspect the story will resemble in some tints to SS2, not sure
2015-10-31 23:14:32	Mneuro	razieliyo not really.  It is definitely not better than Super Metroid for SNES.  It is better than most other metroidvania games though
2015-10-31 23:15:00	razieliyo	it may be the hype of the moment haha, that metroid really rules
2015-10-31 23:15:04	razieliyo	gba ones are good too
2015-10-31 23:16:20	razieliyo	meh, we need to throw a lot of money at this guy
2015-10-31 23:24:57	@sakuramboo	speaking of which, what was the name of that one metroidvania game that was on kickstarter, something about time and manipulating time
2015-10-31 23:25:33	@sakuramboo	timespinner
2015-10-31 23:25:35	@sakuramboo	thats it
2015-10-31 23:32:39	Mneuro	Also, if you haven't played Dust then that's another great metroidvania

Some website or something where you can say "I'm usually available on Saturdays" and then you get a confirmation mail a day in advance, where you can cancel that if necessary. And if nobody's available everybody should get a mail or something. Does something like that exist? >_>
