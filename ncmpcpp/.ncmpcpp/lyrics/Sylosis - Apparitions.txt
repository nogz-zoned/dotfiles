How quick the seasons change
The leaves turned from green to grey
A flickering Apparition hovers above

So familiar
Yet so distant
Preserved in age
Icey hands support a somber face

Like a curse of immortality
Father time mocks me

Through grave and tomb
Past valley and precipice
Emerges the ghost of retribution

The horizon burns
Set light by kin and blood
A snake amongst us
Has soured this soil

Sometimes I hope you aren't looking down on me
To witness what I've become

Through time you will see what blinds you
Beholder of all light
Turn back the stone
To your slumber return

Suspended on a tide of obscurity
A wraith missing a crown

It almost feels like
Time is standing still
Yet somehow time
Has drained me of my youth

The years I've waited,
Have all but slipped away,
Torn from me

Father time forever mocks me

I have become,
I have become powerless,
Powerless

I have become,
I have become so emotionless

Through time you will see what blinds you
Beholder of all light
Turn back the stone
To your slumber return
