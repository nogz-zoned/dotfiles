You know!
ou hear those cries of anguish
ach time
         
           that you face the mirror
and those deafening voices blames me
but that's more
than I'm trying to hear
so let the pain revive you
never let me get inside you
Never...again.
lets just oppress this
demon within
the abyss is a friend
you breathe deceit
and I'm surprised I still stand on my feet
you know that
I live
I breathe
hate
our days were agony
and therefore so tragically
there was satisfaction
hate fucking in apathy
So fucking
tell me
were there days when things were so much better?
before
you were such a self loathing hateful bitch.
recognize the hell that you're spewing forth
what we might have shared is nothing anymore
what you said to me
was never meant to be
Never.... again....
