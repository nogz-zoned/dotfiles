Hope has never felt this way before
Wasted so much time and so much more that I let go
Let it die
Let it go
I would ask you why but it would kill me just to know
To know your ending is just the beginning
My bloods draining
That beautiful mouth...drinking it down
The truth is found with me, six feet under ground
Hope has never felt this way before
Wasted so much time and so much more that I let go
Let it die
Let it go
I would ask you why but it would kill me just to know
Is this dead or will it live again?
This derails my thoughts for bliss
Too bled to triumph, I was left here powerless
Powerless
In your vengeance lies my strength
And I will see this 'til the end
This derails my thoughts for bliss
Too bled to triumph
I was left here powerless
Powerless
Burned in my sight every night
Every night
I hope to see this to the end
