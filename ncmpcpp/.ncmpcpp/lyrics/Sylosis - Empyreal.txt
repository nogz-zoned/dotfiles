It's said the future's written in the skies
The stars align
Planets collide
Shadows inherit the Earth

Denounce this shallow faith
I have seen through the veil
I espouse this call to arms

Of the Empyreal paradigm
Preaching to all that breathes life
Fear the divine

Denounce this shallow faith
I have seen through the veil
I espouse this upheaval

As stones collide with ignorance
Burrow your feral words into the ground
The graves you've made will pull you down

Holy man keep your revelations to yourself
Deny all you are

Keep your blindfold out of spite
For all who lack direction need a guide

Beneath a sunken sky
We will reap what you've sewn
Bind your mouth
And drop your head down

As stone collide with ignorance
Burrow your feral words into the ground
The graves you've made will put you down
