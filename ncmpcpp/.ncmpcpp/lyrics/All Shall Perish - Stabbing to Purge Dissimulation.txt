How
Have you lost touch with
This

You

are a lie your digging such a grave
gimmicks sell but whats the cost of this
You make me cringe to think that this is to become their place where
the
judgement ends
And now betrayed is where they lay.
Letting hatred build the falling of your system
Its their turn to send you flailing and burning into hellish
dissention.
Loathesome talent
Fleeting
Rehashed bullshit makes you all not worth a piss ..
Bound in your false pretense
We laugh at this as it slowly becomes your end
It's how...
It's how you live the end

Can't believe how you have lost touch with this
They mourn the loss of valiant fools all glam and glitz
Come back, last chance to take a useful stance
Instead of just saying to say things that you biggots wish for but won't
ever have
No chance

They are the
Ones who bring life to us
Fucking Family
How could you betray them
What money
tied with your platinum chains
Fuck, you're cheap
Bought for a few pennies
Now you're all just empty
fucking souless machines

Rip you apart
As they scurry around at your feet
Leave you to wither as if you ever meant anything
your death
Gives breath
For new breeds
They'll crawl
Back into the new hope for all
Left
You forgotten while you lay there rotting
back at your burial ground
Back at your burial ground
