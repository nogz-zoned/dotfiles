since the dawn of time
t's been told that the path of the righteous will lead us to glory
nd through our convictions we're born anew
         
           with the blood of our foes stained on our hands
the seas will flow red when the pale moon rises
and our war will dawn, with its bloodlust quenched
and we'll bring damnation

forged by our darkened hearts
they bear false witness to our righteousness in all
the broken gods we claim,
our destruction reigns as golden idols fall forged by our darkened hearts the broken gods we claim,
left on the battlefield,
cadavers lay impaled
and in the midst of corruption the birth of gods
shall lay waste to foundations

and every city shall fall
burning cities will fall to the ground and every city shall fall burning cities will fall to the ground and return to the ash that once sustained them
the skies will send down
acidic rains and ash storms
and our war will end
with no man left standing

and our war will dawn
with its bloodlust quenched
and every city shall burn and fall
destroyed to ash
and our war will end
with no man left standingand the just shall be smitten in genocides
