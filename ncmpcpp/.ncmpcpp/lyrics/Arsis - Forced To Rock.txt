Let's Rock!

Now the promise of never is replaced with half-hearted lies.
Sworn to kill with this diamond will and scarlet painted eyes.

Forced to rock!

Rebellion, Rebellion.
In the name of devil starve.
To embrace our sins with all we are.
In the name of Satan we are forced to rock.

Riding high on emptiness wearing only flames.
Reciting lines of tainted prose and innocence is slain.

Forced to rock!

Rebellion, rebellion.
In the name of the Devil Starve.
to take down this life with a feast of famine.
In the name of Satan, we are forced to rock.

Reaching out with hands of gold
and famine is the feast.
Where the only hell is growing old
we are starving for the beast.

Alright!

Now the promise of never is replaced with half-hearted lies.
Sworn to kill with this diamond will and scarlet painted eyes.

Forced to rock!

Rebellion, rebellion.
In the name of the Devil Starve.
to take down this life with a feast of famine.
In the name of Satan, we are forced to rock.
