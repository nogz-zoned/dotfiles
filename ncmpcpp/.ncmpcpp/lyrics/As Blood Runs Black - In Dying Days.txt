Leaders are hard to come by,
Followers are omnipresent.

Leaders are hard to come by,
Followers are omnipresent.
Satisfied with a mediocre lifestyle;
Satisfied!

No one is setting a path for us to follow,
No one's striving to be on top.
No one is setting a path for us to follow;
We will all fall in the end!
In dying days!
The path has been set,
You're leading far astray;
Far astray!
The path has been set,
You're leading far astray,
Far Astray!

BRING THE MUTHAFUCKIN RUCKUS!
BRING THE MUTHAFUCKIN RUCKUS!
BRING THE MUTHAFUCKIN RUCKUS!
BRING THE MUTHAFUCKIN RUCKUS!

In darkness!
In darkness!

Unfortunate as you may be,
You'll never see the light.
Someone must rise above,
Someone must precede.
Unfortunate, you must precede!
Unfortunate!

Leaders are hard to come by,
Followers are omnipresent.
Satisfied with a mediocre lifestyle,
Satisfied!
No one is setting a path for us to follow,
We will all fall in the end.
In dying days!
As the time to rise approaches
No one will take responsibility!
