Just call me the living dead
These songs fuel my lust for her flesh
Just hymns for a heart that's a bloody mess
I guess we lived like the dead
Did we stay young 'til we died?
Are just clarified and classified?
I still see the summer sky...
Has stripped, raped and strangled ever made you cry?
Our...black metal hearts drown in black water parks
Damnation...delivered us back to the start
They feel like songs of the damned
Cursed forever...undead...I am
Once upon that crucifixion
We reigned in blood like death had risen, we destroyed the opposition
Our...black metal hearts drown in black water parks
Damnation...delivered us back to the start
Are my arms your hearse if these metaphors stop?
Without these songs, I would just be so lost
So lost
When she rides, I'm stuck in that horror hotel, cursing all 20 eyes
When she rides...when she rides
Well it's 2 minutes past the midnight hour and you hate my voice like sugar coated sour
Caress that carcass
I miss your heartworks
My swansong, so insalubrious
Pouring sweat but the fever remains
It's all pretty odd but more our darkest days
'Cause we let it burn and felt strength just the same
I don't care if you get it
These songs still scream your name
