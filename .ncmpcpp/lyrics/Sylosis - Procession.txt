Crimson hands cursed and bound
Silence broken as the world comes crashing down
All that lives expires
Yet so untimely
Lord dethroned
My brother betrayer

Ripping wounds revealed
Harbinger of doom
The sky has fallen
And I bare it's weight

These walls harbor uniquity
A darkness which never sleeps
Sewing the seeds of doubt within
I am but a pawn

Looming clouds prevail
Concealing the Sun
Weaving a tapestry of guile

I've tried to keep adrift
On a sea of confusion
Drank of the rivers and vale

Life ends here
Commit this body to the ground
Let soil wash over crossed arms
A vessel to the grave
Rests in lament
Life ends here

Pull me up through the sky

Peering through the trees
Wildfires alive in me
Will turn you to stone
I can still see the face
You buried alone

Held in sleep

Life ends here
Commit this body to the ground
Let soil wash over crossed arms
A vessel to the grave
Rests in lament

Banished
Banished
