Tunnels of light capture symbols in the stone
Out of touch and weak
Return this scourge to it's seed

Held in life's quicksand
Emptiness defined
By the blaze ignite
Embody the light

Infinite fires burn through mortal skin and bone
As shapes shift and coil
Darkness departs, divides

Held in life's quicksand
Emptiness defined
By the blaze ignite
Embody the light

Broken to the core
Destroyed by every thought
Pierce through every flaw
Like waves unbounded

Impurity binds the flesh
Wrapped in cold misery
Darkness breathing light, eternally

Impurity binds the flesh
Wrapped in cold misery
Darkness breathing life, empowering

Empowering

Regenerate,
Engage,
Awakening

Regenerate,
Engage,
Bone, body and mind
