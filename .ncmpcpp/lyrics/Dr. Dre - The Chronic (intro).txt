Dr. Dre and Gylan Kain:
This is dedicated to the niggas that was down from day one
Welcome to Death Row
(Like we always do about this time)

Snoop Dogg:
Hahahaha, yeah, nine deuce
Death Row Records, creeping while you're sleeping
Niggas with attitudes? Nah, Loc, niggas on a motherfucking mission
What up niggas and niggettes?
That crazy-ass nigga is back in the motherfucking hizzouse
Yeah, with notorious Compton G D-R-E on a solo tip, fuck them other fools
What up, Ren? Yeah, dropping Chronic flakes on your ass, bitch
West Coast flavor
Niggas who talk shit get dealt with real quick
So if you wanna take a trip to the Row
Let a nigga like Snoop Doggy Dogg know
Protected by niggas with big dicks, AK's and 187 skills
So if it's must you test us, we can handle it the streets nigga, fuck making records
Yeah, G's up, hoes down
If that bitch can't swim, she bound to drizzown
Peace to my nigga Drizzae, another platinum hit nigga
Peace to the D.O.C., still making it funky enough
And Death Row Records is in full motherfucking effizzect
Oh yeah, PS, fuck Mr. Roarke and Tattoo
Aka Jerry and Eazy
Sincerely yours, deez motherfucking nuts
I don't love Eazy, I don't love Jerry
I don't love Ruthless Records
Frankly, I don't love nothing they got to do with
But, but, but you know what I want you do for me?
Jerry and Eazy, check this shit right here
I want y'all to put this bizzalls, in your jizzaws
And work them like a strizzaw, tell me what you sizzaw
Yeah, you know what? You know what?
Fuck all y'all, fuck y'all
Really though, it's Death Row, nigga
You better ask somebody, you really better ask somebody

Dr. Dre and Solomon Burke:
(Get out, get out, I don't love you no more)
Yeah, nigga, you's a penguin lookin' motherfucker
