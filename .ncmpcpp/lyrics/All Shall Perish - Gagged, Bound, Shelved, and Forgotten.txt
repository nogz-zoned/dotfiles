Denied, a whisper, a voice to try
To fill the chambers destroyed by lies
Feels we're faking, our power is draining
Out of our hands
Don't
Don't let them take our nation
Let
Don't let them take our nation
Them
Don't let them take our nation
Take
Our nation, leaving us drifting through falsehood
Redemption is gone
They tell us that we're fine
That we choose our rights
Our choice a fight
What fucking lies
They slay our minds
This is for penance
This end for silence
Blunt force reminds us
We all are taking the fall
And if they think they've won
They better think...
They fucking better think twice
We've degradated to violence
We own
More than you'll ever know
We own
The streets and your fucking home
Us not them
I've tired, waiting for help
For an answer, for some savior...
They have no hope left to sell
So don't let them take our nation
Today
Let's rise to reach
For that tomorrow that lives inside you and me
I would die fighting for that day
I would die for our day
