Through compulsion
eceptive thoughts escape
evealing a leech within
         
           All blood replaced
Archaic Ancestry
Consuming the mind
Shape shifting
Hallowed guise
Soul engraved
Becoming a corporeal slave
Beneath the surface
Lies another being
Seeping through your skin
Beguiling
Transparent
Words flow like venomous spit
Shape shifting
Hallowed guise
Soul engraved
Becoming a corporeal slave
Riddled with disease
It breathes
It bleeds
It speaks
Lies
The mask of humanity breaks
Jaws open to expose this vile creature
Possessed in flesh uttering hypocrisy
Nothing does it taste
It's only purpose is to secrete verbal waste
Leech within
Holding to
One ounce of truth
All see through
To what lies beneath you
A constant struggle inside
Biologically lobotomized
Before you speak and even begin to think
Remember you're merely a man and not a god
