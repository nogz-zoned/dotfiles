All control is lost
Senses deprived
Deaf ears still hear the malign

The altars crumbling
Cloak of obscurity
A crown wrapped tight around you neck
Gaunt hands to hold you back

I've seen the world in a new light
No holy shrines
Nothing to resemble eternal life

Now turning back I see,
What could have been but never was
A pressure so dense,
Upon my chest it could paralyze

Lucid

A mask forced upon me
Impaled by fear

Reaching out to just beyond me
Slipping beneath the tide

Stones drag to the riverbed below
Below

Death is here
And he's been clawing at my thoughts again
Forever drowning in perdition

Submerged in azure waters
