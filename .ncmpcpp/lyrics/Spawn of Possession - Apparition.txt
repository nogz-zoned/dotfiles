Heavily secluded from all but faith
A family in hiding from the world 
Firm praying, blind loyalty, reciting words divine
From the eldest to the youngest one
Their sheer belief in the son's return
If not stayed true, in the abyss would burn

The apparition
A messenger of the eternal scripture
Phantom of shine
Disembodied and descent of heaven
The apparition
Her appearance was so real 
Without suspicion
All the prayers of the family were finally heard

On a humid spring evening
When the idyll couldn’t be more perfect
Out from their flower garden
Through the blinders came an overwhelming light

They gathered on the porch and stood and watched in awe
Angelic deity, so clean, like the purest dream
Their fingers laced together
As they dropped to their knees worshipping
Happy pearly tears, oh such beauty lives

Sweet angels die look up on me
the apparition spoke with a silky
Yet whirring voice of wonder
You have been faithful to the omnipotent
I come to grant you a challenge of life
Time to show your true worth to the Lord

A paradise awaits the few undoubting 
To measure up and prove them self abiding
Fulfill the needs of dominus

Then it disappeared, the unearthly seer
Left the witnesses impaired
Now they knew for sure that praying
Was the door to his holiness' embrace
The parents and younglings
Went inside and began chanting pages
In front of the altar that they had build
Next to the tepid white tile store

The apparition
She came and gave them hope
The apparition
Why would she dupe, poor the people thought

Their black bound bible got scrutinized
Inside the father’s head a voice would rise

Which said
An unbeliever (the filthy child)
Among your flock (I order you to punish)
Your scrupling daughter (that whoring freak)
Is against us (and make her bleed)

He yanked her arm and pulled her outside
Shoved her to the dirty wall of the toolshed
While hearing the apparition
Whipped her good 'til it got messy
Grabbed an axe he was steered by frenzy 
Just do it the voice kept ranting

As he cut away his little girl
Someone walked up behind him screaming begging
Cried in panic 
He turned around and saw his loving wife
Without a blink he then knew to attack her 
Voice kept praising
Feeding her the hatchet
As the apparition kept applauding
The spouse's onslaughter
Limbs was flying
The only child remaining was his body
Who saw the whole thing from the kitchen window
Shocked in terror

Then the voice said I shall appear
You have proven yourself worthy
Bring me the last life of your family
Called the boy out then came the light
There it was the apparition
Reached out for his traumatized son’s small hand
Free from sin you'll come with me

The apparition, a messenger of the eternal scripture
Phantom of shine, disembodied and descent of heaven
The apparition, her appearance was so real 
Without suspicion, all the prayers
Of the family were finally

The apparition changed form into a contorted creature
Held the child in its bosom and vanished in a laughter
The father now roams around the little flower garden 
God's work he did it with pride
The final lock on the gate is now open
