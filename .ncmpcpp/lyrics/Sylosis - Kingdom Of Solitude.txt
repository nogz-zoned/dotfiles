I am your keper
And this wall will protect
Will all great at Neptune's ocean wash the blood from my hands

Transformed and tiresome
A ghostly vision of what life used to be

Dead eyes stare aimlessly
At what's beyond

In need of anguish
The penalty repaind
To end the means

I am Impurity

Imprisoned in a cold shell
So isolate
Awating the grave

Wallowing in exile
A ritual sacrifice
The hunter has come

Dead eyes stare aimlessly
At what's beyond
In need of anguish
The penalty repaid
To end the means

Teacher! Leader!
Show us how to feel pain and remorse
Bleed these lacerations dry
Until I cease the urge to exploit

This Kingdom of Solitude
A personal hell
I must try not to feed off the pain
That I once reveled in

A lone wolf in this emptiness
Defeated
I've served this sentence far too many times

This face is scarred and worn
Help me get rid of this crown of thorns
I still feed of the pain
That I once reveled in

Teacher! Leader!
Show us how to feel the pain and remorse
Bled these lacerations dry
Until I cease the urge to exploit
