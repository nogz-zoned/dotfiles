Shrouded in darkness
It has formed a wreath around you
Wisdom comes through exile
And through this alone
Moon's lapse
Escape the trance
Your throne grows cold

The day breaks into,
A thousand shards
Dawn breaks into,
Everlasting night

Shrouded in darkness
It has formed a shell around you
Wisdom comes throughr exile
And though this alone
Moon's lapse
Escape the trance
Before you grow old

The light has lost it's path
No Sun will rise in the epoch of the shadow

Light blinds our eyes
Eclipsing dark Luna's sky
Flooding the night

The face of the Earth
Silent yet still alive
Pulled into the night
