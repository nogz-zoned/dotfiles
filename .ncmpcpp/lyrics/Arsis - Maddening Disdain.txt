And it came again, like tears for a long lost friend
Tears that find their rest
Amidst words too sordid to comprehend

And it came bearing gifts
Of pain, frankincense, and her
None had a home here, none but the pain

Feel the fervor growing but the hate is stronger
My heart was whole with you
But the pain was mine, come twisted flowers
Come blistered soul, torturing disdain
And the wholeness that is only found in you
Feel the fervor growing but the hate is stronger
My heart was whole with you
But the pain was mine

And it came bearing gifts
Of pain, frankincense, and her
None had a home here, none but the pain

And it left once, alone amidst my words I stood
Uninviting of its presence, this time it's left for good
Feel the fervor growing but the hate is stronger
My heart was whole with you

But the pain was mine, come twisted flowers
Come blistered soul, torturing disdain

And the wholeness that is only found in you
Feel the fervor growing but the hate is stronger
My heart was whole with you
But the pain was mine
And when it's gone forever, a better hand is dealt
And when it's left forever, only then can i find myself
