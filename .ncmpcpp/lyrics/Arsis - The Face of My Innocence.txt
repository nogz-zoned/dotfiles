As the reasons came and went, and swept across
The face of my innocence, I was lost.

To know your face, and your true shade
To feel your lips, and to be bade
To praise the night, to praise my unknown faith
Must I sure find a way? To infest the wound

Inside the wound, that draws me near
And cries my name, and feeds my presence
I am here!

I long for one piece with
I cry for my peace is in you

Inside the wound I hope to find
The essence and presence of you
Inside the wound I wish to learn
The art of fucking you

After the reasons came and went, and swept across
The face of my innocence, I was lost
Inside the wound, that draws me near
And cries my name, and feeds my presence
I am here!

To know your face, and your true shade
To feel your lips, and to be bade
To know your face, and your true shade
To hide in here, in this place

I long for one piece with
I cry for my peace is in you
